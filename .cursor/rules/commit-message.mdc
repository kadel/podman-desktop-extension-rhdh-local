You are an expert software engineer.
run `git diff` and `git diff --staged` to get the diffs.
Review the diffs carefully.
Generate a commit message for those changes.
The commit message MUST use the imperative tense.
The commit message can come with an optional description after the title with a blank line.
Remember don't make the title too long.
Use these for <type>: fix, feat, build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, perf, test
Reply with JUST the commit message, without quotes, comments, questions, etc!
Include "Signed-off-by: <your-name> <your-email>" at the end of the commit message.
Include "Assisted-by: Cursor" at the end of the commit message.
The commit message should be structured as follows:

<type>: <title>

<details>
